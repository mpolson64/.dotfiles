# .dotfiles ✊🏽
My dotfiles. They're not great but they're what I use; if you'd like to use them feel free, but once again they're not very good.

## Emacs
Emacs is the primary editor I use heaviest. The key/largest packages include:
* Evil
* Helm
* Company
* Projectile

## Git
Nothing worth mentioning.

## Vim
Vim was my first editor and I still use it when I need a fast tool that exists in the command line. Plugins are managed with Vundle, but things are kept minimal and generally lightweight:
* Ctrl-p
* Vim Surround
* DelimitMate
* Supertab
* Anzu
