# .dotfiles ‚úäüèΩ
My dotfiles. They're not great but they're what I use; if you'd like to use them feel free, but once again they're not very good.

## Neovim
My current primary editor. My current config includes many plugins that take advantage of Neovim's async features. I use the following plugins (managed through Plug):
* FZF
* Tabular
* Autopairs
* Vim Surround
* Deoplete (with Jedi and Tern integration)
* Ale
* Airline

## Emacs
Emacs was my primary editor; I have since switched to Neovim but the Emacs configuration remains as I left it when I last used it. The following are the primary packages I use:
* Evil
* Helm
* Company
* Projectile

## Git
Nothing worth mentioning.

## Vim
Vim was my first editor and I still use it when I need a fast tool that exists in the command line. The following pugins are managed with Vundle, but things are kept minimal and somewhat lightweight:
* Ctrl-p
* Tabular
* Autopairs
* Vim Surround
* Supertab
* Airline
